  I am a student who is currently enrolled in NYU's Tandon Bridge Program, a 24-Week (or 17-Week) program meant for those who want to obtain a master's degree in a Computer Science field, but lack the formal education.

  In essence, the program itself is similar to a bootcamp in which you are taught the greatest hits of C.S. (Computer Science), with the prospects of further continuing your education on the masters level after completion. The program has certain certificates for letter grade that a student has achieved, with a B+ or higher being a "Certificate With Distinction", awarded to those who achieve such a grade.

  I have been preparing to take this course for the better part of 2020, whilst being in the forefront of the COVID-19 pandemic, in one of the hardest areas in all of New York City. Regardless, I think the extra few months that I have done researching and familiarizing myself with certain topics that pertain to the program (Thanks to the help of an Alumn that I meet via his blog, check it out here: [https://jonathanmann.github.io/2019/08/04/nyu-bridge-review/](https://jonathanmann.github.io/2019/08/04/nyu-bridge-review/)), the course load so far isn't as daunting as I had imagined.

  For the first week, a great deal was centered around discrete math and propositional logic (if p then q, not p or q, etc.), which I had luckily prepared for through the wise spending of $20 dollars on Udemy for an introductory discrete math course. Now, the part that I was not aware of was the use of LaTeX, a software system used for formal publication of scientific research. I was prepared to write out the assignments given to us in a word.docx document format because its synonymous withâ€¦ well most forms of computerized documentation.

  Though once I got comfortable using LaTeX, especially through the use of the online editor Overleaf, I've come to appreciate how powerful LaTeX is.

  Firstly, the .cls or "class" file is amazing when it comes to properly formatting your LaTeX, `.tex` file. The `.cls` file basically includes all the "packages" that you would like to include in the formatting of your document. For example, if you have a package that includes creating circles of a certain circumference in your `.tex` file you can instead move this package from the `.tex` file and into the `.cls` file. You can then call the package into your `.tex` file from your `.cls` file.

How you may ask?

  That's because the `.cls` file compiles the packages within that file, with your `.tex` file, so that if a package is called in your .tex file, then the appropriate output will be displayed without including it directly with you work. So instead of having a mish-mash of all included packages and text in your `.tex` file, you can separate them for a smoother workflow. You can also export your favorite `.cls` files between `.tex` files if the packages that are called in the `.tex` files are also in the `.cls` file, and if they aren't you can just add them to the `.cls` file and have LaTeX compile them with ease.

  In all, I look forward to using LaTeX in the upcoming weeks, to further hone my own understanding of the software along with answering the various questions about universal and existential statements, and proving arguments such as "There is no smallest number." with finesse.
