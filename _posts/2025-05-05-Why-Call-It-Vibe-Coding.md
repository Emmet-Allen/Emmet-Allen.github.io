Honestly, why are we calling it vibe coding?

It's pretty silly and doesn't express what it actually is, and for someone who has been hounded with questions regarding naming variables and functions with the best name of all time 'banana', I feel as though the name 'vibe coding' should be under the same scrutiny. 'Vibe Coding' is what I'm doing when I'm two~three beers deep during a weekend night, working on some personal project that I don't really care to test all that much, and will probably end up in the void which is my GitHub repository. In my opinion, 'vibe coding' is a state of programming that is nonchalant in its approach to a particular program that is being developed; I don't care if my silly attempt of creating a Bloomberg terminal doesn't see the light of day, I'm just vibing to Nujabes trying to see if numbers go up or down.

Can we just call it what it is, 'assisted programming'? Yeah basically all programming done in modern IDEs can be categorized as 'assisted programming', but in this case its just a shortened version of 'AI-assisted programming'. I'm not 'vibe coding' when I'm trying to ask AI to help me optimize a complicated event system, I'm performing 'assisted programming' to do that task. I can use 'assisted programming' while I 'vibe code' on my silly CLI Fart-Noise tool, but to ask me to 'vibe code' for a critical feature... nah, I'm good.
