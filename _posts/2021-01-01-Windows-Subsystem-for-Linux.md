  Windows Subsystem for Linux is a separate system that runs inside your Windows 10 OS, which makes the use for those who at least want to experiment with Linux/GNU a chance to do so without accidentally partitioning your whole C:\\ Drive.

  Honestly, dual-booting can be hard for some. Even if you are installing a user friendly Linux/GNU Distro, such as Pop! OS or Ubuntu, but why bother with learning how to safely partition your drives and installing boot-loaders when Microsoft has already done the work for you. 

  Not only is WSL a great way to expose Linux/GNU for  those who are unfamiliar, but it also provides Linux/Windows developers a way to increase workflow. This is due to files and applications that are held within the WSL system to interact between each other, which makes it possible for users to have their VIM and VScode and eat it too.
