This is the fourth part of the OOP primer series, where we discuss the concept of Inheritance and the idea that objects being able to inherit certain pieces of data from their 'parent' object.

As always, if there are any comments please feel free to email me. 


**<u>Inheritance</u>**
Going back to the "you" object, I really like your hair, it fits you and
it matches your eyes very well. Did you get your hair texture from your
mom? Your dad? Maybe it's a mix of both, maybe you **Inheritted** both
of the traits from your mom and your dad. **Inheritance** is the OOP
concept that any child class can have the same data and methods as the
parent class before them. So let's say you inherited your hair texture
from your mom, and your mom inherited their hair texture from their mom,
so on and so forth until we get to the first person who has ever existed
whose name is "Person".

Now "Person" was the first one who has ever had a name ("Person"), an
age, and other characteristics that can be only found in them (The
ability to walk, the ability to eat, etc.). Because "Person" is your
great\^n-parent, you inherited some of their characteristics such as the
ability to walk, but also have characteristics of your own such as the
ability to play the computer and a social security number. With
Inheritance, the child classes do take on the characteristics of the
parent class, but they can also add their own characteristics that may
be only found in them or can only be inherited through a long lineage of
inheritance. In OOP, this line of inheritance is the same; the child
class inherits the data of the parent class, but the child class can
modify and add to this data if need be.
