## [Flexi-Buddy](https://udify.app/chat/MSxRFJAgZB0Dl9ET)
### <u>Description</u>

Flexi-Buddy: The Generated AI Flexibility Assistant

Flexi-buddy is a RAG GenAI app that is powered by gpt-3.5-turbo and uses multi-path retrieval to provide outputs based on specific flexibility-exercise context information.
The app was created with the mindset of helping people generate simple flexibility exercises using simple provided details. These include:

Age: Your age
Flexibility Level: Your current flexibility level (e.g., beginner, intermediate, advanced)
Activity Type: The type of activity you engage in (e.g., yoga, running, office work)
Weight: Your weight
Body Part: The specific body area you want to focus on (e.g., back, legs, shoulders)

Flexi-buddy will then take these user inputs and generate a flexibility plan in the form of an easy-to-follow table, which includes:

Stretch Name: The name of the recommended stretch.
Suggested Time Per Set: How long to hold the stretch.
Suggested Sets: The number of repetitions for each stretch.
Description: Step-by-step instructions to perform each stretch effectively.

## [QuickCalc](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/quickcalc/ibneokgnnenppcokmejepfdjhapepece)
### <u>Description</u>

QuickCalc is a Google Chrome Extension created by both myself and my brother Erick Allen. The purpose of QuickCalc was to enable quick calculations of some simple and slightly complex
math equations while my brother was using in-browser textbooks, specfically ZyBooks. QuickCalc has the ability to do simple arithmatic in the format of variables, where the variables inputed 
depending on the option selected will give the desired output. This enables the ability for the calculator to do more complex arithmatic formula's such as Euclid's GCD, Euclid's Triple, k-Permuations, and a few more. The calculations are then saved to a history list, so that the user can look back at previous calculations for the given session.

## [Bald_E VirtualMe](https://github.com/Emmet-Allen/Bald_E-VirtualMe)
### <u>Description</u>

Bald_E is a virtual 3d model of... well myself. Why would I create a virtual version of myself, you may ask? My life involves a ton of meetings, and sometimes I am not looking as spiffy as I should, or I don't want to be on camera but I want to be visually 'present' if that makes sense. To solve this issue I created a virutal version of myself which is protected and under BSD 3, so I am legally protected if anyone were to use my virtual likeness. It was created using Vroid studio, where I connect to VSeeFace for facial recognition and virtual camera capabilities.

## [Untitled Platformer](https://github.com/Emmet-Allen/Platformer)
### <u>Description</u>

A hobby project I'm creating to learn more about game developement. This project is using the Lua programing langauge, and the Love game engine. Currently I have only a debugging stage, but once the game logic is complete I hope to add more interactivity such as collectables, enemies, and more stages for the player to go through.

## [Dataiku and Pace Hackathon 2021](https://github.com/Emmet-Allen/PaceHackathon2021)
### <u>Description</u>

This project was a part of a Hackathon that was three months long (Sept - Nov 2021), in where a group of 3 students, myself included, were tasked with helping
sellers understand what they should sell their homes for, as well as inform them of the most important attributes of a home which influence the price. The project
consisted of webscrapping data from popular real estate websites and passing that information into machiene learning models on the Dataiku platform. We then
were tasked with creating documentation based on our findings along with diagrams and charts.

## [Royal Navy Capital: Online Banking Landing and Sign-In Page](https://royal-navy-capital.netlify.app)
### <u>Description</u>

The general theme for this project was to get re-acquinted with Web Development, specifically Front End Development. React was used for its ease of modularity through the use of conternization via components using the Flux Paradigm to ensure maximum code maintainability and unidirectional data flow. React Stylized Components was used for out-of-the-box intergration with React, further improving on Reacts' modularity by including styling that can be containerized to specific components and further reinforcing the Flux Paradigm. SCSS was used for its pre-processing styling power, enabling the use of global variables and import to be used within a master-style sheet, creating reinforced style containerization for general Web Components when necesscary. React Router was also used to minimize server calls within the page itself by manipulating the DOM of single-page applications, useful for controlling progressive resolution views between pages.

## [City Of Saints and Rebels: Landing Page](https://emmet-allen.github.io/COSAR/)
### <u>Description</u>

City Of Saints And Rebels: Website Concept for Upcoming StreetWear Clothing Brand.
This is a concept website that I developed using BootStrap 5. It works on both desktop and mobile, but is more mobile friendly, with a centered layout. It is in a single page format, and was developed solely as a proof of concept, as asked for by the creator of the brand.

## [F***ing Weather: NSFW Weather](https://f-weather.netlify.app)
### <u>Description</u>

This App uses React, SCSS, and OpenWeather API. The Website is both desktop and mobile friendly. I created this app because I had a pebble watch that had a watch face called "NSFW Time" where the time would be told to you with numerous explitives. I really enjoyed that watchface and this is a homage to that.
