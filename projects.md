## Moonlite: Sleep Tracker Login Screen (Concept)

### URL: https://moonlite-login-react.netlify.app

### Description

This project was created with React as a framework, and using Figma for interface design. I was curious on how to use Figma to better aid in Front-End workflow, so this is the product of that curiousity. I am not the best designer by any means, but I do like the workflow Figma provides, and would be open to using it for more projects in the future.
