## [Royal Navy Capital: Online Banking Landing and Sign-In Page](https://royal-navy-capital.netlify.app)

### Description

The general theme for this project was to get re-acquinted with Web Development, specifically Front End Development. React was used for its ease of modularity through the use of conternization via components using the Flux Paradigm to ensure maximum code maintainability and unidirectional data flow. React Stylized Components was used for out-of-the-box intergration with React, further improving on Reacts' modularity by including styling that can be containerized to specific components and further reinforcing the Flux Paradigm. SCSS was used for its pre-processing styling power, enabling the use of global variables and import to be used within a master-style sheet, creating reinforced style containerization for general Web Components when necesscary. React Router was also used to minimize server calls within the page itself by manipulating the DOM of single-page applications, useful for controlling progressive resolution views between pages.

## [City Of Saints and Rebels: Landing Page](https://emmet-allen.github.io/COSAR/)

### Description

City Of Saints And Rebels: Website Concept for Upcoming StreetWear Clothing Brand.

This is a concept website that I developed using BootStrap 5. It works on both desktop and mobile, but is more mobile friendly, with a centered layout. It is in a single page format, and was developed solely as a proof of concept, as asked for by the creator of the brand.

## [F***ing Weather: NSFW Weather](https://f-weather.netlify.app)
### Description

  This App uses React, SCSS, and OpenWeather API. The Website is both desktop and mobile friendly. I created this app because I had a pebble watch that had a watch face called "NSFW Time" where the time would be told to you with numerous explitives. I really enjoyed that watchface and this is a homage to that.

<!--- ## [Moonlite: Sleep Tracker Login Screen](https://moonlite-login-react.netlify.app)

### Description

  This project was created with React as a framework, and using Figma for interface design. I was curious on how to use Figma to better aid in Front-End workflow, so this is the product of that curiousity. I am not the best designer by any means, but I do like the workflow Figma provides, and would be open to using it for more projects in the future. --->
