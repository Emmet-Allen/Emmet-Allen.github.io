## [City Of Saints and Rebels: Landing Page](https://emmet-allen.github.io/COSAR/)

### Description

City Of Saints And Rebels: Website Concept for Upcoming StreetWear Clothing Brand.

This is a concept website that I developed using BootStrap 5. It works on both desktop and mobile, but is more mobile friendly, with a centered layout. It is in a single page format, and was developed solely as a proof of concept, as asked for by the creator of the brand.

## [F***ing Weather: NSFW Weather](https://f-weather.netlify.app)
### Description

  This App uses React, SCSS, and OpenWeather API. The Website is both desktop and mobile friendly. I created this app because I had a pebble watch that had a watch face called "NSFW Time" where the time would be told to you with numerous explitives. I really enjoyed that watchface and this is a homage to that.

  This App also takes advantage of the Async() and Await() functions, rather than relying on an external frameworks for API calls.

<!--- ## [Moonlite: Sleep Tracker Login Screen](https://moonlite-login-react.netlify.app)

### Description

  This project was created with React as a framework, and using Figma for interface design. I was curious on how to use Figma to better aid in Front-End workflow, so this is the product of that curiousity. I am not the best designer by any means, but I do like the workflow Figma provides, and would be open to using it for more projects in the future. --->
