## [Moonlite: Sleep Tracker Login Screen](https://moonlite-login-react.netlify.app)

### Description

  This project was created with React as a framework, and using Figma for interface design. I was curious on how to use Figma to better aid in Front-End workflow, so this is the product of that curiousity. I am not the best designer by any means, but I do like the workflow Figma provides, and would be open to using it for more projects in the future.

## [F***ing Weather: NSFW Weather](https://https://f-weather.netlify.app)
### Description

  This App uses React, SCSS, and OpenWeather API. The Website is both desktop and mobile friendly. I created this app because I had a pebble watch that had a watch face called "NSFW Time" where the time would be told to you with numerous explitives. I really enjoyed that watchface and this is a homage to that.

  This App also takes advantage of the Async() and Await() functions, rather than relying on an external frameworks for API calls.
