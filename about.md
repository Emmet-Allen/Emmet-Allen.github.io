I'm a fledging developer, in the midst of a daunting but exciting career change from the medical field to the technology realm.

### What Do You Do?

Currently, I work in a psychatric facility as a Theraputic Attendant/Behavioral Health Assistant. Think of someone that a person may come and talk to, who is the middle ground between a friend and a therapist.
