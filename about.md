I'm a software developer who's focused on ethical development and developing tools and applications that can be used for all, by all. 

## What Do You Do?

Currently, I work in a psychiatric facility as a Therapeutic Attendant/Behavioral Health Assistant. Think of someone that a person may come and talk to, who is the middle ground between a friend and a therapist.

However, I am also a part of the City Of Saints and Rebels (COSAR) design team, where I lead web design, along with a few other hats such as customer engagement and brand marketability. We are still small, but you can check us out on [Instagram here](https://www.instagram.com/cityofsaintsandrebels/?hl=en).

## What Do You Know?

What don't I know? (Honestly a lot.) I'm pretty comfortable with C++, Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML/CSS, SCSS, Lua(My favorite language), and some SQL. Most of my workflow is done in the CLI either through PowerShell, Windows Terminal, or other CLI interfaces such as Konsole and with Visual Studio Code (Though I have written functional code in Notepad). The version control I use is Git, where most of my repositories are hosted in GitHub. Lastly, the frameworks that I've used mostly consist of web frameworks such as React, Node, and Bootstrap,  but I'm hoping to extend my framework knowledge for other uses such as Spring and .NET .  

## What Are You Working On? 

I currently am working on a few projects, though my latest completed projects can be viewed [here](https://emmet-allen.github.io/projects/). I will try to update the blog to better reflect what I'm working on, and use it as a Micro-Blog. Though I do like writing about tech so be on the lookout. Also, all help is welcomed!
